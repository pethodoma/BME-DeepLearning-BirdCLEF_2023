# BME-DeepLearning-BirdCLEF_2023

Team name: Deep Dream Team
Names and neptun-codes of the members: Rimai Dániel (BR2BUJ), Skribanek Csanád Mihály (G0OTOY), Pethő Dominik (HEBAPU)
The project is a kaggle competition, (this one: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2023). the goal is to train a model that can predict
based on a sound sample whether or not each of the 264 species of birds provided in the training data can be heard in the sample. 
There is currently only one file in the repository, the Deep_Dream_Team_Milestone1.ipynb, which contains the preprocessing steps.
