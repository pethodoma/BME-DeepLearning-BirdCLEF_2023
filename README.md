## Project Description

The project is a Kaggle competition named [BirdCLEF 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2023). The primary goal is to train a model capable of predicting whether each of the 264 species of birds provided in the training data can be heard in a given sound sample.

## Repository Contents

There are currently three files in the repository:

- [Deep_Dream_Team_Milestone1.ipynb](Deep_Dream_Team_Milestone1.ipynb): This Jupyter Notebook contains the preprocessing steps for the project. This is outdated, the current preprocessing steps can be found in preprocess_final.ipynb
- [Milestone2_Bird_Unet_with_data_loader.ipynb] : This Jupyter Notebook contains one training with the Unet model



## Info about projects current state
We have done the preprocessing steps, and are currently working on training the model
